Sheikhpura Qadeem Website - District Saharanpur
This is a website for Sheikhpura Qadeem in the Saharanpur district. The site includes complete information about all places in Sheikhpura Qadeem—such as educational institutions—and about every village that belongs to Saharanpur district, Uttar Pradesh. The website was created by Sayyed Nabeel Haider. Sheikhpura has been accurately documented here; a comprehensive website like this had not been made until now.
Just like Sheikhpura Qadeem’s website, the homepage has separate sections: one for educational places, another for old shops, a different page for historical visiting spots, and all the details of the villages are also organized separately.
